          2. What are the differences between global scope and local scope?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer"><span>&#8594</span> 
          A variable's scope is the range of the script where it is visible. Variables have either global or local scope. A global variable exists only once in a script, and is visible in every function. Modifications to it in one function are permanent and visible to all functions. Unless declared otherwise, all variables in a script are global. Global variables are useful for values that are relatively constant, or that many functions in the script must access, such as a session id.
<br>
<br>
          A local variable, however, has a limited scope, it exists only within the block that it is declared in. Once that block ends, the variable is destroyed and its values lost. A local variable of the same name declared elsewhere is a different variable. A local variable can even exist multiple times simultaneously, if its block is entered again before it's exited - i.e. a recursive function call. Each call of the function will have a distinct local variable.
<br>
<br>
          Local variables must be explicitly declared, either as parameters to a script function (here), or with the LOCAL statement (here). They are used to clearly pass parameters to functions, or as temporary "scratch space" for a function without the side effects of global variable modification.

          3. How JavaScript event loop works?
        </h2>
        <p class="answer"><span>&#8594</span> The Event Loop has one simple job to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
